									<h3>This is a big one!</h3>
                                    <p>Plenty of features were revealed today, both by Tommaso and Jason! Let's start with Jason's feature reveal. If you look at the first two pictures, you will notice stuff. In the first picture, you see snow on the top of the mountains, and grass below. In the second, you see snow and rain along with snow higher in the mountains. This is quite easy to infer: Temperature decreases with height! Now onto Tommaso's features, all version exclusives. This is a bit more confusing for most people, so I'll explain it to the best of my abilities. In the first feature that Tommaso revealed today, he shows the new /tickingarea command: It replaces spawn chunks, and now you can create updateable chunks even when no players are nearby! As long as the chunk limit is not exceeded, feel free to create as many chunks as you desire! The ticking areas work inter-dimensionally, and it enables features such as crop growth, command blocks, redstone, and mob activity even when the player is not around! Keep in mind that this will likely cause lag. There are also variations to the command, which I shall not list here. Next up, we have a tick_world component to entities. It prevents entities from despawning, and it also makes an entity load the world. It also adds an optional despawn distance that is available for entities which should despawn when players are too far away (example used in pic: ender dragon). Just keep in mind that, "[Tommaso] didn't implement this feature at all, [he's] just tweeting about it because the author isn't on twitter :)".</p>

									<h3>Gamerules!</h3>
									<p>Would you look at that! Jason tweeted earlier today "Day 7: Useful to avoid typing on a touch screen or controller. ~10 more days of features left.". Basically, instead of having to use the /gamerule command, there are now switches in the options menu! Also, as per the last part of his tweet, there are about 10 more features to reveal, not 10 more days until release. </p>

                                    <p>Today, Jason said "#BetterTogether Day 5: Too much armor to wear? Now you can put them on display...". He shared with us a video (above) featuring an armor stand! This is a long-awaited feature. What's more? Version exclusives! Armor stands have arms, can hold tools, and when tapped: they strike different poses! Following this post, Tommaso told us how you can automate the poses by inputting a redstone signal! Awesome! I can't wait to see what's next!</p>

									<h3>What?</h3>
									<p>Taking on a mysterious, yet semi-christmassy tone today, Jason said on Twitter, "On the fourth day of screenshots, MC:PE gave to me ... a screenshot of a map to see #BetterTogether". He left it to us players to figure out what he means. The most common speculation is that there is the ability to dual wield, only arrows, maps, and the totem of undying. Another popular theory is that the sword was redesigned. Take a look, it's a bit different. Then there were some different ones, such as one user suggesting seeing a ravine, and another tweeter suspecting coordinates on the map. I personally have no idea, it's up to you!</p>

                                    <p>Yesterday, Tommaso revealed Stained Glass as an upcoming feature to MCBE! Today, Jason showed something to do with Stained Glass! It just shows what all java users already know: Beacons change color after heading through stained glass. Since this was not technically a "feature" reveal, he gave a true feature: more blocks in the nether! And what's even more special about this? It's coming EVEN SOONER than the better Together update! Awesome! Check out the images above. </p>

									<h3>Books!</h3>
									<p>Jason Major revealed a second feature of the Better Together update today. While he didn't state exactly what this is, the picture implies a lot. Taken from the Windows 10 version, it shows a book with writing, like java has. That's a Book and quill! This also has some features exclusive to the BE (see post 1 for explanation) including the ability to read two pages at once, and the ability to edit individual pages! In addition to Jason's feature reveal today, Tommaso tweeted that he managed to make ice transparent! This also confirms that we will have Stained Glass!</p>

                                    <h3>Minecraft Better Together Update revealed!</h3>
                                    <p>At the E3 conference earlier today, the Minecraft Better Together update was revealed! It has cross-platform play, and it switches the platforms all over to the Minecraft Bedrock Engine <-- the engine that Pocket Edition uses. This version is Minecraft Pocket Edition's version 1.2. Some pre-confirmed features include parrots, firework stars, firework rockets, music disks, jukeboxes, splitscreen functionality, and coarse dirt. Just a tip so you're not confused like I was, everybody is now using the acronyms BE or BC. BE for Bedrock Engine, or BC for Bedrock Codebase. Use either one!</p>
